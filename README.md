# getdata

This project contains a single R script, run_analysis.R, that will create an tidy dataset from a zip file of Samsung Galaxy accelerometer measurements.  

This script can be executed from the command line with the following command: 

`R -e 'source("run_analysis.R")'`

The script will produce a file called output.txt with the final, transformed dataset.
